        <p>As its name implies, the To-do list on an article's talk page shows the list of improvements 
          suggested for the article. It is created and formatted using the {{Todo}} template. The list is 
          maintained by editors, writers, reviewers or readers like you as a way to focus your collaborative
           efforts. As such, they represent a tentative consensus that helps improve the efficiency of the 
           editing process</p>
